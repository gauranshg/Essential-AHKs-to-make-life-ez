## BlockMouse

This script blocks the mouse while the '!' key is pressed. This is useful for preventing accidental mouse clicks while using the keyboard.

## CodeWEz

This script creates a GUI window with a button for each item in a CSV file. When a button is clicked, the associated text is copied to the clipboard.

## CodeWEz_Beautiful

This script is a modified version of CodeWEz. It uses a more modern GUI style and adds some additional features.

## FileVersionCreator

This script creates a new file with the next version number based on the current file name. For example, if the current file name is "example_1.txt", the script will create a new file called "example_2.txt".

## VolumeControl

This script allows you to control the volume using the '+' and '-' keys. You can also use the 'm' key to mute the volume.
